                <h3>What is CWA?</h3>
                <p>Chennai Weekend Artist - is my most desirable community till now. CWA is a group of Artist and Art lovers who gather somewhere in Chennai for painting, "Sorry not only for painting but also for sharing love, kindness and experience". Art lovers from other countries are also joining virtually. So for me CWA is a Classic World Artist group. One thing I admired in this 15000+ community is - there are art lovers from age 6 to experienced artist age 70 and the talent and maturity the budding artists have is really amazing and we should learn more from them. I can still remember there was one autism child whose age was 14, who can't able to understand the world of people but he understands and loves the world of colors and he is the best in that.</p>

                <h3>Get together!</h3>
                <p>
                    On every weekends we will meet up in a temple/ park/ market/ zoo, etc... the time and place will be posted on the CWA facebook page. After that we will start to draw something we like in there and next everyone will share and explain their paintings and of course at the end they will share food and love.

                <h3>What I learnt</h3>
                <p>
                    I have joined CWA on May 2019. I have learnt many tricks, thoughts and techniques from this group without paying anything which we can get it from paid workshops and its not about money it's the Culture and Environment I have learnt and I love!
